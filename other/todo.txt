update willhill deposit and withdrawals? I fucked it up
should be 100 deposit 0 withdrawal

insert bet - let it take a decimal

update get_bets to be a page that just refreshes with bets - dont have to push button
when bet is taken remove it from the table
 - new table in db?

add transfer funds functionally to website

expand bets to more than moneyline{
    store pinnacle spread in new table (new func not moneyline)

    if the spreads are the same just compare the juice with the spread
    - can add different spread later?
        - have to calculate how much a point costs in spread with each sport
}


graphs with bets and bookie numbers over time?

put a list of funcs at the top of bet history with inputs and outputs, and a descirption of what it does

clean up code inside tworesult and threeresult? - and other places (variable names, efficiency)
 - add comments
