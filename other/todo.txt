wagered seems to be right, wagerable is off by a little on betrivers, and the net/bankroll is way off


update get_bets to be a page that just refreshes with bets - dont have to push button
when bet is taken remove it from the table

display bookie table on website - graphs

expand bets to more than moneyline

clean up code inside tworesult and threeresult? - and other places (variable names, efficiency)
 - add comments
